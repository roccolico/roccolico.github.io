My research interests and scientific experience are mainly focused on the investigation of the statistical and physical
properties of *supermassive black holes (SMBHs)*, by means of the *very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI)* technique. 

If you are not familiar with all this, let me try to elaborate a bit more about SMBHs and the VLBI technique.

*SMBHs* are those black holes with masses of the order of million to billion times the mass of the Sun and play a fundamental role in the cosmic evolution of their host galaxies. Basically, every massive galaxy in the universe hosts a SMBH at its center, including our own galaxy, the Milky Way, that hosts a 4.3 million solar masses SMBH, known as *Sagittarius A\* (SgrA\*)*. 

An extremely high angular resolution is required to access such compact regions, that can be achieved either by increasing the observing frequency either using a very large telescope aperture. In this context, the most powerful tool is the so-called *VLBI technique*, that consists in using two or more radio telescopes, separated by a distance called baseline, which simultaneously collect the electromagnetic radiation, like a diffraction grating. Such array of telescopes mimics a high-resolution single virtual radio telescope with a diameter equivalent to the maximum baseline length (that for a ground-based array is represented the Earth diameter). 

To be continued...
