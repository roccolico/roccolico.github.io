# About me

Hey, thanks for visiting this page! I'm currently a Severo Ochoa Postdoctoral fellow at
[Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC)](http://www.iaa.csic.es){:target="\_blank"}. I'm also affiliated with the [Italian National Institute of Astrophysics (IRA-INAF)](http://info.ira.inaf.it/en/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interests and scientific experience are mainly focused on the investigation of the properties of super massive black holes and their relativistic jets, by means of the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) technique. For more info about my research work please take a look at the page of our [research team](http://vlbigroup.iaa.es/){:target="\_blank"}.

I'm a member of the [Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/){:target="\_blank"} (EHTC), playing an active role in several science working groups (Imaging, Polarimetry, active galactic nucleai and outreach). In the imaging working group I co-lead the antenna gains and the parameter survey teams. I'm also the Information-Technology Officer of the EHTC and member of the Management Team Secretary.
