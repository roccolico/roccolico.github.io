# About me

Welcome to my (most likely not-very-up-to-date) webpage! This is not meant to be a formal (and boring) cv, but rather a collection of a few basic notes about my work. 

I'm an astrophysicist and staff researcher at [Istituto di Radioastronomia - Italian National Institute of Astrophysics (IRA-INAF)](http://info.ira.inaf.it/en/){:target="\_blank"}. In the past years I also worked at [Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC)](http://www.iaa.csic.es){:target="\_blank"}, [Max-Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR, Bonn)](https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/2169/en){:target="\_blank"}, [University of Bologna (UniBO)](https://www.unibo.it/it}{:target="\_blank"), and I did part of my PhD research work at the [Boston University (USA)](https://www.bu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. 

My research interests and scientific experience mainly focus on the physics of **super massive black holes** and their **relativistic jets**. I make use of the so-called **very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)** technique, that consists in synchronizing multiple radio telescopes across the globe, and provides us with the highest angular resolution achievable from Earth. By pushing the VLBI tecqnique to the limit, at mm wavelengths, with the [Event Horizon Telescope](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/){:target="\_blank"} (EHT) collaboration we are now able to directly image the horizon-scale emission of super massive black holes (the so-called **black hole shadow**). 


In the EHT collaboration I play several leading roles ([webpage](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/organization){:target="\_blank"}): 
- AGN science working group coordinator. 
- Co-lead of parameter survey and antenna gains teams. 
- Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Officer.
- Management Team secretary.

I'm also member of the **Next-generation Event Horizon Telescope** (I'm one of the facilitators of the multi-wavelength science team of the "BHs and their cosmic context" working group), **Global mm VLBI Array (GMVA)**, **Radioastron space-VLBI**, and **East Asia to Italy nearly global VLBI** scientific pojetcs.

Among other things, I'm a member of the [Time Allocation Committee for the Italian radio telescopes](https://www.radiotelescopes.inaf.it/tac.html){:target="\_blank"}), I'm principal investigator of several observing projects and co-supervised several student thesis and projects.
