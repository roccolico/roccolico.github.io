# About me

Hey, thanks for visiting this page! I'm currently a Severo Ochoa Postdoctoral fellow in Astrophysics at
[Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC)](http://www.iaa.csic.es){:target="\_blank"}. I'm also affiliated with the [Italian National Institute of Astrophysics (IRA-INAF)](http://info.ira.inaf.it/en/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interests and scientific experience are mainly focused on the investigation of the properties of super massive black holes and their relativistic jets, by means of the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) technique. For more info about my research work please take a look at the page of our [research team](http://vlbigroup.iaa.es/){:target="\_blank"}.

I'm an active member of the [Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/organization){:target="\_blank"} (EHTC), in which I cover different roles. On the science side, I'm one of the coordinators of the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) working group, and co lead of the antenna gains and parameter survey teams in the Imaging working group. On teh management side, I'm the EHTC Information-Technology Officer and the Management Team Secretary.

For a more detailed cv please drop me a message [rlico@iaa.es].
