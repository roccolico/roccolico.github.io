# About me

Welcome to my (most likely not-very-up-to-date) webpage! I'm an astrophysicist, currently postdoctoral fellow at [Istituto di Radioastronomia - Italian National Institute of Astrophysics (IRA-INAF)](http://info.ira.inaf.it/en/){:target="\_blank"}, and 
[Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC)](http://www.iaa.csic.es){:target="\_blank"}. 

My research interests and scientific experience mainly focus on the physics of super massive black holes and their relativistic jets. I make use of the so-called very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) technique, that consists in synchronizing multiple radio telescopes across the globe, and provides us with the highest angular resolution achievable from Earth. 

By pushing the VLBI tecqnique to the limit, at mm wavelengths, with the [Event Horizon Telescope](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/organization){:target="\_blank"} (EHT) collaboration we are now able to directly image the horizon-scale emission of super massive black holes (the so-called 'black hole shadow'). 

For more info about my research please explore the other pages from the menu, or take a look [here](http://vlbigroup.iaa.es/){:target="\_blank"}, or just drop me a message [rlico@iaa.es].
