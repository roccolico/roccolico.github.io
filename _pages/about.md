# About me

Welcome to my (most likely not-very-up-to-date) webpage! This is not meant to be a formal (and boring) CV, but rather a collection of a few basic notes about my work. 

I'm an astrophysicist and staff scientist at [Istituto di Radioastronomia - Italian National Institute of Astrophysics (IRA-INAF)](http://info.ira.inaf.it/en/){:target="\_blank"}. Over the past years, I've also worked at [Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC, Spain)](http://www.iaa.csic.es){:target="\_blank"}, [Max-Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR, Germany)](https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/2169/en){:target="\_blank"}, and [University of Bologna (UniBO, Italy)](https://www.unibo.it/it}{:target="\_blank"), and I conducted part of my PhD research at [Boston University (USA)](https://www.bu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. 

My research interests and scientific experience are primarily focused on the physics of **supermassive black holes** and their **relativistic plasma jets**. I use very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), a technique that synchronizes multiple radio telescopes across the globe, to achieve the highest angular resolution attainable from Earth. By pushing VLBI to its limits at millimeter wavelengths, with the [Event Horizon Telescope](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/){:target="\_blank"} (EHT) collaboration we are now able to directly image the horizon-scale emission of super massive black holes, what’s often referred to as the **black hole shadow**. 

As part of the EHT collaboration, I had the privilege of contributing to the first-ever horizon-scale image of the four-million-solar-mass black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*. For this work, I co-led both the parameter survey and antenna gains teams, and for my contribution I received one of the ([2022 EHT early-career awards]([https://eventhorizontelescope.org/organization](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/awards-eht)){:target="\_blank"}). 

I’m also an active member of other scientific collaborations, including the **Square Kilometer Array Observatory**, **Next-generation Event Horizon Telescope**, **Einstein Telescope**, **Radioastron space-VLBI**, and **East Asia to Italy nearly global VLBI**, among others. I serve on the [Time Allocation Committee for the Italian radio telescopes](https://www.radiotelescopes.inaf.it/tac.html){:target="\_blank"}), lead several observing projects as Principal Investigator, and have co-supervised multiple student theses and research projects.
