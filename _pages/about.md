# About me

Welcome to my (most likely not-very-up-to-date) webpage! This is not meant to be a formal (and boring) cv, but rather a collection of a few basic notes about my work. 

I'm an astrophysicist and staff scientist at [Istituto di Radioastronomia - Italian National Institute of Astrophysics (IRA-INAF)](http://info.ira.inaf.it/en/){:target="\_blank"}. In the past years I also worked at [Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC)](http://www.iaa.csic.es){:target="\_blank"}, [Max-Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR, Bonn)](https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/2169/en){:target="\_blank"}, [University of Bologna (UniBO)](https://www.unibo.it/it}{:target="\_blank"), and I did part of my PhD research work at the [Boston University (USA)](https://www.bu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. 

My research interests and scientific experience are primarily centered on the physics of **supermassive black holes** and their **relativistic jets**. I employ very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)—a technique that synchronizes multiple radio telescopes around the world—to achieve the highest angular resolution attainable from Earth. By pushing the VLBI tecqnique to the limit, at mm wavelengths, with the [Event Horizon Telescope](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/){:target="\_blank"} (EHT) collaboration we are now able to directly image the horizon-scale emission of super massive black holes (the so-called **black hole shadow**). 

With the EHT collaboration, I had the privilege to play an active role in making the first ever horizon-scale image of the four million solar masses black hole at the center of the Milky Way, known as Sagittarius A*. For this work, I co-led the parameter survey and antenna gains teams and for my contribution I received one of the ([2022 EHT early-career awards]([https://eventhorizontelescope.org/organization](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/awards-eht)){:target="\_blank"}). 

I'm also member of other scientific collaborations, like the **Next-generation Event Horizon Telescope**, **Einstein Telescope**, **Radioastron space-VLBI**, **East Asia to Italy nearly global VLBI**, et al. I'm part of the [Time Allocation Committee for the Italian radio telescopes](https://www.radiotelescopes.inaf.it/tac.html){:target="\_blank"}), I'm principal investigator of several observing projects and I co-supervised several student thesis and projects.
