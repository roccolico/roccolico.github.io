# About me

Hey, thanks for visiting this page! I'm currently a Severo Ochoa Postdoctoral fellow in Astrophysics at
[Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC)](http://www.iaa.csic.es){:target="\_blank"}. I'm also affiliated with the [Italian National Institute of Astrophysics (IRA-INAF)](http://info.ira.inaf.it/en/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interests and scientific experience are mainly focused on the investigation of the properties of super massive black holes and their relativistic jets. For this purpose, I use of the so-called very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) technique, that consists in synchronizing multiple radio telescopes across the globe, providing us with the highest angular resolution achievable from Earth. 

By pushing the VLBI tecqnique to the limit, at mm wavelengths, with the [Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/organization){:target="\_blank"} (EHT) we are now able to directly image the shadows of super massive black holes. In the EHT Collaboration I'm one of the coordinators of the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) working group, and co-leader of the antenna gains and parameter survey teams in the Imaging working group. On the management side, I'm the EHTC Information-Technology Officer and the Management Team Secretary.

For more info about my research work please take a look at the page of our [research team](http://vlbigroup.iaa.es/){:target="\_blank"}. And for a more detailed cv just drop me a message [rlico@iaa.es].
